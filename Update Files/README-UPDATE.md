README – Updating the Soundboard

This folder has two updater files:

Update Sound Pack.html → downloads the newest sound pack as a .zip.

Update Version.html → downloads the newest project HTML file (the app itself).

----How to Update the Sound Pack----

Update Sound Pack.html in your browser.

Download the .zip file.

Then extract it by two-finger clicking on it and going down to "Extract All". 

Then drag the folder inside Your SoundPort folder, then your folders folder.

Delete the old sound pack folder in your project.

-----How to Update the Project----

Open Update Version.html in your browser.

Download the new HTML file.

Go to your soundboard project folder.

Delete the old HTML file.

Drag the new HTML file into the folder.

----Notes----

If you don’t see changes, refresh with Ctrl + Shift + R (Chromebook hard refresh).

Keep the folder names the same as before so the soundboard knows where to find the sounds.
